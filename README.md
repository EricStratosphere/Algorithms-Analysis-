# Algorithms Analysis 

This github repository analyses and compares the behavior and runtime of different categoried Algorithms such as sorting algorithms, graph algorithms and minimum-spanning-tree algorithms. This repo compares different algorithms in their respective categories, identifying each strength, weakness and the right situation to be used. For example, my analysis on sorting algorithms pits together Bubble sort, Merge sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, and Selection sort, five among the most common sorting algorithms in DSA. Each Jupyter Source File also contains their own markdown to provide a more detailed insight on the analysis.

# How to access
- Install jupyter notebook in your local machine, if you haven't already.
- Clone the github repository and open the terminal in the directory.
- input "python -m notebook" to open jupyter notebook.
